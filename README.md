# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Anshul!

I love building things â€” whether that means writing backend logic, working on real-time hardware integrations, or experimenting with AI models.

I enjoy working across both software and hardware. My projects often involve microcontrollers, voice control systems, and local AI integrations. Iâ€™ve also been exploring deep learning with PyTorch and bckend development

Always open to collaboration, learning, or working on meaningful projects. Feel free to connect!
